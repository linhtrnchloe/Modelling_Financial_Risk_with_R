I was provided with a dataset about a fund concentrating on investing in Artificial Intelligence.

First of all, I extracted the data from 5 most recent years, measured all the descriptive statistics. Then I started calculating the VaR and ES for parametric model, Monte Carlo, historical simulation and Cornish-Fisher. 

I also fitted T-student model and GARCH for the data and backtesting its VaR. I concluded that GARCH model fit the data better.
